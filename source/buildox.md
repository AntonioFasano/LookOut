Building Documentation
-----------------------

Documentation is built with `doxygen` and a custom VBA-class filter, developed by me.
To generate fresh documentation use the following:

	1. Make sure doxygen is installed.  If not,  install it.
	2. If the path for `doxygen.exe` is not `%%ProgramW6432%\doxygen\bin\doxygen.exe`, edit `buildox.cmd` and modify the path accordingly.
	3. Run `buildox.cmd`



<!--  LocalWords:  doxygen exe buildox cmd
 -->
